The Four Major Theories of Computation

Automata Theory – Studies simple machines like finite automata and how they recognize patterns or languages.
Computability Theory – Looks at what problems can or can’t be solved by a computer, no matter how powerful.
Complexity Theory – Focuses on how much time or resources a computer needs to solve a problem.
Formal Language Theory – Deals with how languages are structured and what rules define them using grammars.
