I looked over the code and found a few issues:

1)The class name C is too short. Should be more descriptive.
2)The constructor is empty and not needed.
3)zero() works but the name isn’t clear, something like getDefaultValue() would be better.
4)The map is final but still mutable. If it’s meant to be read only, it should be wrapped with Collections.unmodifiableMap().
5)Can use the diamond operator (<>) in new HashMap<>() to make it cleaner.

I used a Java linter and just some basic code review skills to spot these.
