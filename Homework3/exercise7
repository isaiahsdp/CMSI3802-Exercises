The second version of the countdown function doesn't work because of this line:
setTimeout(update(i), 1000);

This calls update(i) immediately and passes the result (undefined) into setTimeout. So the countdown stops after one update because nothing gets scheduled after that.



Here’s my fixed version:

function countDownFromTen() {
  function update(i) {
    document.getElementById("t").innerHTML = i;
    if (i > 0) {
      setTimeout(() => update(i - 1), 1000);
    }
  }
  update(10);
}

This works because we’re passing a function to setTimeout using an arrow function. That way, update(i - 1) is only called after the delay, not immediately.
