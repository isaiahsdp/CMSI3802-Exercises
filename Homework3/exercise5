Carlos allows recursive structs, but only if the recursion happens through an optional type. You canâ€™t have a struct directly contain itself. Instead you have to use a field like Node? so the compiler knows the field might be empty and avoids size calculation issues.
This is important because having a struct contain itself directly would cause an infinite loop when figuring out how much memory it needs. The compiler enforces this during semantic analysis and will throw an error if you try to do it without using optional.
