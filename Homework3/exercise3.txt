Describe how the languages Java and Ruby differ in their interpretations of the meaning of the keyword private. 
You can use an AI chatbot for help, but please trim down the long-winded applications those tools are known for, 
and give a concise explanation that proves you truly understand the difference.

Java
- private methods and fields are only accessible within the same class
    - you cannot access private methods through inheritance
    - you cannot call them directly through subclasses

example:
class A {
    private void secret() {
        System.out.println("Secret");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    void accessSecret() {
        secret(); // Compile-time error
    }
}

Ruby
- private methods are accessible within the same class and subclasses
    - only implicitly (without self)

example:
 class A
  private
  def secret
    puts "Secret"
  end
end

class B < A
  def access_secret
    secret         # Works — implicit call allowed
    self.secret    # Error — cannot call private method with a receiver
  end
end

Regarding the keyword private, Java enforces stricter encapsulation, whereas Ruby allows more flexibility in the context of visibility.
